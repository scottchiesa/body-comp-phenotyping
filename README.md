## ABSTRACT 

### Background
The extent to which physiological or pathophysiological processes may explain associations linking body composition and cardiovascular adaptations in young adulthood remains unclear. 
### Methods
Four hundred and thirteen young adults from a sub-study of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC in London Cohort) underwent extensive body composition and cardiovascular phenotyping at age 21±1 years. Associations between measures of fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) and a wide-range of structural and functional phenotypes were tested, with prior knowledge of well-established physiological relationships between these variables used to guide the interpretation with respect to whether observed differences represented potential physiological versus pathophysiological adaptations.
### Results
Levels of FM and FFM varied widely within individuals, resulting in differences of 10-15% of body fat percentage between sexes at any given body mass index (BMI). In multivariable models adjusted for FM, higher FFM was found to be associated predominantly with cross-sectional hallmarks of cardiovascular remodelling, characterised by cardiac hypertrophy (e.g. mean difference [95%CI] in left ventricular mass per 1kg increase in FFM = 20 [18,23] g; p<0.001), stroke volume (15 [13,18] ml, p<0.001), and cardiac output (0.5 [0.3,0.7] L/min; p<0.001). These associations were seen alongside reduction in proxies for systemic vascular resistance (SVR), preserving mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the face of increased haemodynamic requirements and suggesting a predominantly physiological adaptation to an increase in somatic growth and lean tissue mass. In contrast, little association was observed between FM and cardiac remodelling after accounting for underlying FFM, with most associations with FM instead relating to numerous markers of autonomic dysfunction and accompanying increases in mean arterial pressures. As a result, overweight/obese individuals with a higher body fat percentage (i.e. greater relative adiposity) were observed to have smaller hearts beating at an increased rate against a higher afterload compared to those with a lower body fat percentage but equivalent body mass index.
### Conclusions
Many cardiovascular phenotypes commonly attributed to adiposity in young adulthood – particularly those involving structural remodelling – may instead represent physiological adaptations to cope with the increased haemodynamic demands of increased levels of underlying FFM. Caution should be exercised when interpreting these changes as the early evolution of subclinical disease as the long-term implications of these differences remain to be determined.
